# SeqSim
 
This is an example module to use with https://github.com/adrsch/SeqScript

It contains the codebase for an first person immersive sim. 

In the future it will be split into some additional MIT-licensed pieces, and with permission parts can be used under that license. But for now, if you use it (and have to add additional code - which is not necessarily required, it's fully functional as-is), make sure to release your project under a free license.
